WDI Project #1
Jeremy Koulish

***Instructions***
Overview

For this project, you have a choice of a few different games / apps:

Blackjack
Concentration (aka Memory)
Trivia (Self-scoring)
Flash Cards
Everyone will get a chance to be creative, and work through some really tough programming challenges – since you've already gotten your feet wet with Tic Tac Toe, it's up to you to come up with a fun and interesting project to build.

You will be working individually for this project, but we'll be guiding you along the process and helping as you go. Show us what you've got!

Technical Requirements

Your app must:

Render in the browser
Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files
Stick with KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles
Use Javascript or jQuery for DOM manipulation
Deploy online, using Github Project pages.
Use semantic markup for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices)

Necessary Deliverables

A hosted copy of your game or app, built by you, hosted on Github pages.
Your HTML/CSS should pass the HTML5 Validator and CSS Validators
A git repository hosted on Github with frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project
A link to your hosted project in the URL section of your Github repo
A readme.md file with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.
Suggested Ways to Get Started

Break the project down into different components (data, presentation, views, style, DOM manipulation) and brainstorm each component individually. Use whiteboards!
Use your Development Tools (console.log, inspector, alert statements, etc) to debug and solve problems
Work through the lessons in class & ask questions when you need to! Think about adding relevant code to your game each night, instead of, you know... procrastinating.

Commit early, commit often. Don’t be afraid to break something because you can always go back in time to a previous version.

Consult documentation resources (MDN, jQuery, etc.) at home to better understand what you’ll be getting into.
Don’t be afraid to write code that you know you will have to remove later. Create temporary elements (buttons, links, etc) that trigger events if real data is not available. For example, if you’re trying to figure out how to change some text when the game is over but you haven’t solved the win/lose game logic, you can create a button to simulate that until then.

Project Choices

Blackjack

Make a one-player game where the computer deals and the user plays according to the rules of blackjack.

Bonus:

Add multi-player support
Add Computer AI

Useful Resources

MDN Javascript Docs (a great reference for all things Vanilla Javascript)
jQuery Docs (if you're using jQuery)
Github Pages (for hosting your game)
Project Feedback + Evaluation

Project Workflow: Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task tracking, and/or ERDs, as specified above? Did you use source control as expected for the phase of the program you’re in (detailed above)?

Technical Requirements: Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

Creativity: Did you added a personal spin or creative element into your project submission? Did you deliver something of value to the end user (not just a login button and an index page)?

Code Quality: Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors have in class?

Problem Solving: Are you able to defend why you implemented your solution in a certain way? Can you demonstrate that you thought through alternative implementations? (Note that this part of your feedback evaluation will take place during your one-on-one code review with your instructors, after you've completed the project.)

Total: Your instructors will give you a total score on your project between:

Score	Expectations

0	Does not meet expectations.
1	Meets expectactions, good job!
2	Exceeds expectations
This will serve as a helpful overall gauge of whether you met the project goals, but the more important scores are the individual ones above, which can help you identify where to focus your efforts for the next project!
